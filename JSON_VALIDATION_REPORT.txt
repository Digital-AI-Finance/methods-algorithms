CRITICAL FINDINGS
=================

1. JSON FILES NOT REFERENCED IN CODE
   Status: CRITICAL
   
   Search for "sections/*.json" in HTML and JavaScript files returned ZERO matches.
   
   The JSON files exist but are:
   - NOT loaded by HTML files
   - NOT referenced in JavaScript
   - NOT used by reveal.js presentations
   - NOT loaded dynamically
   
   These appear to be ORPHANED ASSETS created but never integrated.

2. ONE SLIDE COUNT MISMATCH
   Status: MINOR
   
   File: L02_deepdive.json
   - Defines max slide: 33
   - Actual presentation: 34 slides
   - Slide 34 is not included in any section definition
   
   ACTION REQUIRED: Update Summary section to include slide 34

3. DUPLICATE FILE TYPES
   Status: MODERATE
   
   Two file patterns exist:
   
   Type A (Detailed):
   - L0X_overview.json (4 sections, 10 slides each)
   - L0X_deepdive.json (5-6 sections, 24-35 slides each)
   - These match actual presentations
   
   Type B (Minimal):
   - L0X_TopicName.json (3 sections, 7-8 slides)
   - Examples: L01_Introduction_Linear_Regression.json
   - Purpose unclear - appear to be legacy or placeholder files
   
   ACTION REQUIRED: Remove or document purpose of Type B files

4. PMSP FRAMEWORK MISMATCH
   Status: MODERATE
   
   Course documentation describes PMSP framework:
   - Problem (15 min)
   - Method (45 min)
   - Solution (45 min)
   - Practice (75 min)
   
   But JSON files use generic section names:
   - Overview files: Introduction, Fundamentals, Applications, Summary
   - Deepdive files: Introduction, Theory, Implementation, Examples, Advanced Topics, Summary
   
   PMSP alignment assessment:
   - Strong (5-6 sections matching PMSP concepts): L01_deepdive, L03_deepdive, L04_deepdive
   - Partial (4 sections, some PMSP overlap): Most overview files, L05_deepdive, L06_deepdive
   - Minimal (3 generic sections): All L0X_TopicName.json files

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

HIGH PRIORITY (Do First):
1. Determine Purpose
   - Are these JSON files meant to be loaded by reveal.js?
   - Are they for a REST API endpoint?
   - Are they for static navigation generation?
   - Search the entire codebase (including backend) for references
   
2. Fix L02_deepdive.json
   - Update Summary section: "slides": [32, 33, 34]
   
3. Investigate Type B Files
   - Remove L01_Introduction_Linear_Regression.json and similar files
   - OR document their specific purpose

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Do Soon):
4. Align with PMSP Framework
   - If JSON is student-facing, rename sections to match PMSP
   - Update documentation to clarify the naming convention
   
5. Consolidate File Types
   - Decide: Keep only detailed (overview + deepdive) files
   - Remove 3-section variants unless they serve a specific purpose

LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have):
6. Add JSON Schema
   - Create schemas/sections.json documenting the expected structure
   - Add validation to CI/CD pipeline
   
7. Document Integration
   - Add comments in JSON files explaining their role
   - Update CLAUDE.md with JSON file structure and purpose

TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================

All JSON files follow this structure:

{
  "sections": [
    {"name": "Section Name", "slides": [1, 2, 3, ...]},
    ...
  ]
}

No schema or version field present.
No metadata (title, description, author) present.
Slide numbers are contiguous arrays.
All files parse successfully with Python json module.

INTEGRATION STATUS
==================

Checked Files:
- docs/index.html: No JSON references (static HTML, no slide data loading)
- docs/js/main.js: No JSON references (only scroll spy and menu toggle)
- All reveal.js presentation HTML files (L0X_*.html): No JSON references

NOTE: HTML files contain hardcoded data-section and data-slide attributes
      but do not load from JSON files.

CONCLUSION
==========

Status: ORPHANED ASSETS

All JSON files are syntactically valid and contain reasonable slide structure
definitions. However, they are NOT integrated into the frontend and appear to
be unused artifacts.

The most likely scenarios:
1. These were created for future functionality that was never implemented
2. Initial implementation planned to load JSON dynamically, but shifted to static HTML
3. These are meant for a backend system not yet discovered

NEXT STEPS:
1. Search for JSON file references in entire repository (including backend code)
2. Decide: Keep, Remove, or Implement Integration
3. Document the purpose of each file type in CLAUDE.md
