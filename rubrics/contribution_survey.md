**This survey is CONFIDENTIAL.** Responses are used only by the instructor to ensure fair individual grading. Survey results will not be shared with team members.

If a team member's average rating across all peer assessments is more than 1.5 standard deviations below the group mean, the instructor will conduct a brief (5-minute) individual oral defense to verify understanding and contribution.

Individual grades may be adjusted up to ±10% based on contribution evidence (survey + commit history + oral defense) if there is clear evidence of significantly unequal contributions.
